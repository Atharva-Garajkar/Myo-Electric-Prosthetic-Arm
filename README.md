# Myoelectric Prosthetic Arm

## Project Overview
This project introduces a **low-cost myoelectric prosthetic arm**, aiming to improve accessibility for individuals with upper-limb amputations. By leveraging **3D printing** and **electromyography (EMG) sensors**, this prosthetic arm offers customizable, user-friendly, and affordable solutions while maintaining high functionality and usability.

## Features
- **Customizable 3D-Printed Components**: Personalizable to ensure a perfect fit for each user.
- **EMG Sensor Integration**: Detects muscle signals and translates them into intuitive control commands.
- **Enhanced Grip Strength**: Supports various grip patterns such as pinch, power, and precision grips.
- **Lightweight and Comfortable**: Made from materials like PLA to ensure comfort for prolonged use.
- **Affordable and Accessible**: Significantly reduces costs compared to traditional prosthetic devices.
- **Natural Aesthetic Design**: Customizable covers to resemble a natural limb, boosting user confidence.

## Technology Stack
- **3D Printing**: Used for fabricating components.
- **Electromyography (EMG) Sensors**: For detecting muscle activity.
- **Arduino Microcontroller**: For processing EMG signals and controlling motors.
- **Servo Motors**: Provide precise and responsive movements.
- **Lithium-Ion Batteries**: Efficient and rechargeable power source.

## Dataset and Signal Processing
- **EMG Signals**: Muscle contractions are processed to control the prosthetic arm's movements.
- **Signal Threshold**: A predefined value ensures the arm responds only to significant signals.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Visual feedback for fine-tuning performance and responsiveness.

## How to Use
1. **Setup**: Install EMG sensors on the residual limb and connect them to the Arduino-based control unit.
2. **Calibration**: Adjust the signal threshold to suit individual muscle strength.
3. **Operation**: Use muscle contractions to control the prosthetic armâ€™s movements, including gripping and releasing objects.

## Advantages
- **Cost-Effective**: Priced at a fraction of traditional devices, making it accessible to underserved populations.
- **Easy Maintenance**: Modular components for simple repairs and replacements.
- **User-Centric Design**: Focused on comfort, usability, and adaptability for diverse user needs.

## Future Scope
- **Advanced Control Systems**: Integration with brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and AI for more intuitive control.
- **Enhanced Sensory Feedback**: Incorporating tactile sensors to provide users with a sense of touch.
- **Broader Accessibility**: Open-source designs to foster innovation and community-driven improvements.
